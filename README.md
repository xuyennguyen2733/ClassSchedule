# ClassSchedule

Website that shows my class schedule

This is the first website I have ever built from scratch on my own. The idea is to create a website that allows you to create your class schedule, style your calendar, save old schedule, export schedule as pdf and/or an image file. However, those are the ultimate goal. For this initial state, I only aim to recreate my summer class schedule with Disney's Evil Queen theme that I created using excel.

Progress log:

    5/14/2022:
        - Created the initial website with a simple, incomplete calendar using grid
        - Calendar divided into cells to resemble how the original calendar's division
